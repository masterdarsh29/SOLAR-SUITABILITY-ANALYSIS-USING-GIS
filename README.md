# SOLAR-SUITABILITY-ANALYSIS-USING-GIS
The solar suitability modeling project utilizing ArcGIS aims to assess optimal locations for solar energy installations. By analyzing spatial factors such as solar radiation, land use land cover, water bodies. Through data acquisition, image processing and analysis using ArcGIS tools, supervised machine learning algorithm for prediction.
